An experimental, fast Nintendo DS emulator using multithreading and dynamic code recompilation.

**This is highly experimental software. I am developing this emulator only for fun and to learn more about emulation, optimization and 3D graphics.
I do not intend to replace any of the established DS emulators. If you are looking for a mature emulator, [melonDS](github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS) is the way to go.**
