A fast-ish Nintendo DS emulator with a [JIT recompiler](https://github.com/fleroviux/lunatic) and multithreading.

**This is highly experimental software.** 
I am developing this emulator for fun and learning only.
I do **not** intend to replace any of the established DS emulators.  
**If you are looking for a mature emulator, [melonDS](github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS) is the way to go.**
